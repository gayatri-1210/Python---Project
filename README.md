This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Seattle Weather dataset using Python. The main objective is to understand and visualize various weather patterns in Seattle by analyzing features such as precipitation, wind speed, and temperature (both maximum and minimum). Using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project performs data loading, inspection, and a series of visualizations including bar plots, distribution plots, joint plots, pair plots, strip plots and box plots. These visualizations help uncover trends and relationships between weather variables, providing valuable insights into Seattleâ€™s daily weather conditions. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (python.ipynb) with all the code and plots, along with the dataset (seattle-weather.csv).
